/*
 * Memory Management Breakdown:
 * Method Area: Stores class-level information  (e.g., static schoolName). 
 * Heap: Stores objects and their instance variables  (e.g., studentName, rollNumber).
 * Stack: Stores method calls and local variables (e.g., marks, points). 
 * PC Register: Tracks the current instruction

/*
 * Execution from Source File to Output: 
 * Compilation: javac School.java â†’ Compiles into School.class (bytecode). 
 * Class Loading: JVM loads the class into the method area.
 * Bytecode Verification: JVM verifies the bytecode for security. 
 * Execution: JVM runs the bytecode (Interpreter or JIT Compiler).
 * Output: Results are displayed on the console.
